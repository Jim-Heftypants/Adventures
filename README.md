## Adventures
### A fully vanilla JS web application where users can select and play through levels, controlling up to 4 unique characters simultaneously to defeat enemies.
### It utilizes a class framework for character entities which runs entirely based upon their interactions with each other. An external structure sets entities based upon user level selection and allows them to begin interacting. Doing this fully separates functional and class based code which makes it far more efficient, scalabilable, and dry.
